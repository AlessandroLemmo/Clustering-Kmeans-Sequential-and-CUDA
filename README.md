# Clustering-Kmeans-Sequential-and-CUDA

The application implements the K-Means clustering with two modalities: sequential and parallel in CUDA that is an extension of C programming with functionalities for the parallel code implementation, developed by Nvidia.

The times of exexution of the two modalities have been compared considering the following aspects:
- variation of number of threads for the parallel mode
- variation of number of point to clustering
- variation of number of clusters

The project was developed with Visual Studio. For replicate the result download the project and load this from Visual Studio in the follow way:
- Click on File -> Open -> Project/Solution
- Select the .sln project file and click to Open

In the folder _report_ there are:
- Relation of the project
- File excel that reports all time results
- Powerpoint presentation of the project
